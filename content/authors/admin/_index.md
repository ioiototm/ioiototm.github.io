Hi there! I'm Yoan-Daniel, a Research Fellow at the University of Southampton who loves exploring new ways of creating immersive and interactive experiences with Virtual Reality (VR). I'm also a passionate developer and creator who enjoys working on projects that bring people together through technology and creativity.

üöÄ **What I‚Äôm Working On**:
- **[LoGaCulture Project](https://www.logaculture.eu/)**: Developing a locative AR game for the **Avebury Stone Circle**, blending cultural heritage with modern technology.
- **Open-Source Projects**: I enjoy sharing my work with others, whether it's project files, code, or art assets. Everything I create is open for exploration and reuse - you can check out some of my **[projects](project)** and **[GitHub](https://github.com/ioiototm)**, and feel free to build on them!

üéÆ **Passions & Projects**:
- Game development inspired by storytelling and unique mechanics, with favorites like *The Stanley Parable*, *Undertale/Deltarune*, and *Outer Wilds*.
- Making music with my drums, guitar/bass, keyboard, and tools like **FL Studio**.

üìñ **Research Highlights**:
- Explored how different modes of interaction in a multi-modal co-op VR game influence immersion and co-presence.
- Published the subsequent findings of the experiments [here](publication).
- Developing a locative AR game for the **[LoGaCulture Project](https://www.logaculture.eu/)**.

---

‚ú® **Why Open-Source?**
I believe creativity thrives when ideas are shared. By making my work open, I aim to:
- Help others learn from my projects and techniques.
- Encourage collaboration, remixing, and innovation.
- Make tools and resources accessible to anyone who wants to experiment.

Check out my **[itch.io](https://ioiototm.itch.io/)** for downloadable games and **[GitHub](https://github.com/ioiototm)** for source code and other projects. If something catches your eye, feel free to dive in and make it your own!

üîç *P.S. Keep an eye out - exploration might just unlock a little secret!*

I'm a PhD student at the University of Southampton. My research area focuses on Virtual Reality (VR) and multi-modality - the different ways of including a second player in a VR game, and how that affects each participant in it. 

I am also interested in Game Design and Development, and have worked on a few small game projects.




You can check my research in the "Research" section above.
I also like games, so I've gone to a few Game Jams and created a few small prototype games, as well as a number of games for a game course I undertook at university and for my research as well. To see the games I have made, check out the "Games" page above.
For other programming projects, you can check "Other projects", which might include more things than programming in the future.
